I grew up in NE Portland, OR and went to Grant High School. I completed my B.A. in Mathematics from the University of Oregon and a Masters in Engineering from Portland State University. I have an affinity for music as well as software. I've been developing software since 2010 and playing music professionally since 2001.

I have worked with a variety of technologies but I got started in my professional career using C/C++. Not too long afterwards I began moving towards C#. I've used many aspects of the .NET framework from 2.0 to 4.5+ (imagine not using LINQ!). I have a passion about learning and have spent time with PHP, JS Frameworks (such as Knockout and Angular) and Java (see my github for details). I also work on mobile apps (usually Android). It is enjoyable to make something that can add more convenience to my life.

I have played music in notable Portland area venues such as The Doug Fir, Mississippi Studios and The Crystal Ballroom.
