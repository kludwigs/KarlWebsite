I am a native of Oregon. I grew up in NE Portland and went to Grant High School. I completed my B.A. in Mathematics from the University of Oregon and a Masters in Engineering from Portland State University. I have an affinity for music as well as software. I've been developing software since 2010 and playing music professionally since 2001.<p>
