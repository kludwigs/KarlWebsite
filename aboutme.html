<p>
I grew up in NE Portland, OR and went to Grant High School. I completed my B.A. in Mathematics from the University of Oregon and a Masters in Engineering from Portland State University. I have an affinity for music as well as software. I've been developing software since 2010 and playing music professionally since 2001.

<p>
I have worked with a variety of technologies but I got started in my professional career using C/C++. Not too long afterwards I began moving towards C#. I've used many aspects of the .NET framework from 2.0 to 4.5+ (imagine not using LINQ!). I have a passion about learning and have spent time with PHP, JS Frameworks (such as Knockout and Angular) and Java (see my github for deails). I also work on mobile apps (usually Android). It is enjoyable to make something that can add more convenience to my life.

I have played music in notable Portland area venues such as The Doug Fir, Mississippi Studios and The Crystal Ballroom.

I also write music (not the lyrics) to songs. Two of which have been made into music videos! <span style="color:#800000">"Dirty Love"</span> and <span style="color:#800000">"Lay Me Down"</span>!
